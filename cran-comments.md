- This is a re-submission of a new release. Thank you for the very prompt 
  response.
- Two notes from the manual review have been adjusted: (1) The redundant phrase
  'this packages' provides was removed from the Description field. (2) Names
  of other software in the title and description are now in single quotes (
  ex: 'tidymodels').
