Description: This package provides functions that extend the 'tidymodels' 
    ecosystem <https://www.tidymodels.org/> to enable usage of predictive models
    with offset terms. Models with offsets are most useful when working with 
    count data or when fitting an adjustment model on top of an existing model 
    with a prior expectation. The former situation is common in insurance where 
    data is often weighted by exposures. The latter is common in life insurance 
    where industry mortality tables are often used as a starting point for
    setting assumptions.
